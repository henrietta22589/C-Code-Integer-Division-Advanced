# C Exercise that checks if integers are divided with a group of numbers
The aim of this project was to sharpen my C coding skills. 

I have developed a program that enabled the user to provide (up to 7 digits) integers and using an algorithm the program informed if the integers can be divided with a preset group of numbers (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 25, etc.).
